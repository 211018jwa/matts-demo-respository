# Agile

## Background
![agile diagram](./agile-diagram.png)

In the 1990s, a small group of thought leaders got
together and developed a new philosphy called Agile.

In 2001, this group published to the web what is known
as the **agile manfesto**. This is when Agile really started
to be formalized as a philosophy that is now prevalent in
most organization.

Agile is the process of iterative development. This means
we pass through the SDLC multiple times (infinite number
of times even).

This enables
- Feedback
- Respond to change

Instead of delivering an entire product at once, the product
is released incrementally via each interation.

# Agile Manifesto 4 Core Values
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation
    - Financial transactions with a customer and negotiating with
    them is important
    - But collaborating with the customer, receiving feedback, etc.
    is more important
- **Responding to Change** over following a plan
    - Plans are important
    - But responding to change is more important

# Agile Manifest 12 Principles
From the 4 core values, we can derive the 12 principles of Agile software

1. The highest priority is to satisfy the cusomter through early and
**continuous delivery** of valuable software
2. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple
of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
3. Working software is the primary measure of progress
4. Agile procccess promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users
shoudl be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
5. Business people and developers MUST work together daily throughout the project
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a
development team is face-to-face conversation
7. The best achitectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
8. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support
they need and truth them to get the job done.
9. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then turns
and adjust their behavior accordingly
10. Continous attention to technial excellence and good design enchances agility
11. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work NOT done, is essential
12. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage

# Agile Methodologies / Frameworks
Agile, simply put, is a philosophy. It does not highlight specific processes to actually
be Agile. Agile frameworks such as the ones listed below are actual implementations of the
Agile phiolosphy.

- Scrum
- Kanban
- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Scrumban = Scrum + Kanban

Within training, we will be primarily focused on Scrum. Particularly, you will want to try to 
adhere to Scrum during Project 2 + 3.

- Project 2 (group project)
- Project 3 (cohort project)
