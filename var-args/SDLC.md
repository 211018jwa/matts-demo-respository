#Software Development Lifecycle

The software development lifecycle is a process to
follow when developing software. The SDLC defines
phases necessary for a project from its initial
creation to development and maintenance.

# SDLC Phases
1. Requirements Phase
    - Phase where planning for the upcoming project
    happens
    - Waht needs to be developed?
    - What sort of functionaliry are we envisioning?
    - What is the project schedule going to look like?
    - Business Analysts (BAs) + Senior team members
2. Analysis Phase
    - Gather together documents (requirements) for
    the new system
    - Resolve any ambiguities and inconsistencies in
    the requirements
    - A software requirement specification document 
    (SRS) is created
        - Software and hardware requirements are
        formally defined
    - BAs and Seniour developers
3. Design Phase
    - Outline technial details for the application
        - Infrastructure
        - Database structure
        - System interfaces
        - User interfaces
    - Psuedo-code, diagrams, wireframes, etc.
    - System architects + Senior developers, UX
    designers
    - Design documents are produced
4. Development Phase
    - Developers write code and build the applicaton base on the
    design documents
    - Junior and Senior developers
5. Testing Phase
    - Equally as important as the development phase
    - The software is tested to find bugs
    - Bugs that are found are fixed
    - The software at the end of the his phase should meet the
    requirements laid out in the requirements and analysis phases
    QA memembers (Testers) + Developers
6. Deployment Phase
    - The application is deployed to dedicated servers for hosting it
    - System Administrators + Developers
7. Maintenance Phase
    - Ensure that the system is up and functional and has high
    availablilty
    - Resolve new issues (bugs) based on user reports
    - Developers + System Administrators + Site Relability Engineers +
    Customer support + Busines Analysts (receiveing feedback from the
    customer)

# Conclusion
These phases are a high level description of the software development
lifecycle. The details depend on how we choose to follow the SDLC.

There are 2 main competing philosophies:
- Waterfall
- Agile
